Final Project 


A shiny application that allows for visual exploration of a data set, giving the user the ability to manipulate and control of plot features in a way that allows for powerful, complex stories to be uncovered through visual display of the data.

The interactivity adds significant value beyond what could be accomplished in a static visualization.

The [documentation](https://github.com/angelesmarinbatana/Shiny-App/blob/main/documentation) and [R code](https://github.com/angelesmarinbatana/Shiny-App/blob/main/app.R) is thorough, clean and efficient. The [user interface](https://github.com/angelesmarinbatana/Shiny-App/blob/main/documentation/user_guide.md) needs is user friendly and agile.
